  },
  {
    q: "Is First Aid Angel a substitute for accredited first aid training?",
    a: "No. We strongly encourage everyone to complete a hands-on, accredited first aid course (Red Cross, St John Ambulance or equivalent). First Aid Angel is designed to support trained responders and guide untrained bystanders when no other help is immediately available.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where does the medical guidance come from?",
    a: "Our guidance is based on the Australian First Aid Manual (5th Edition), the Australian Resuscitation Council guidelines and ILCOR consensus science, cross-referenced with WHO, Red Cross and St John Ambulance materials.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the app work offline?",
    a: "Yes. Once installed to your home screen, the core first aid guidance, CPR guide and knowledge base work without an internet connection — critical for remote areas, disasters or any time signal drops out.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data private?",
    a: "We do not sell personal data. Chat queries are used to give you guidance and improve safety. Location is only used when you explicitly ask features like the AED Finder to locate the nearest defibrillator.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is First Aid Angel free?",
    a: "Yes. The app is free to use. We support our work through optional donations to partner first aid charities and an affiliated first aid kit shop — all clearly marked.",
  },
  {
    q: "What languages are supported?",
    a: "First Aid Angel is available in 48+ languages with medical-safety-aware translation, so bystanders can help across language barriers.",
  },
  {
    q: "How accurate is the AI?",
    a: "The AI is grounded in vetted first aid sources and conservative safety prompts — it will always recommend calling emergency services for anything serious. It is not a diagnostic tool and does not give medical advice beyond established first aid practice.",
